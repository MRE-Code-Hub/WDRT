# http://wec-sim.github.io/WDRT/

(NOTE: This branch is meant for an in-progress rebuild of the WDRT so that it works for Python 3. There are no dependencies that prevent this, according to the package caniusepython3). 
This will proceed using the python module python-future, which aids in porting code over to Python 3. Because new updates to dependencies are assuming users will use Python 3, the WDRT code may not work on Python 2 installs.
